# Welcome to FinOps by Frank Contrepois.

Hello and welcome. I am Frank Contrepois, a serial learner and pathological sharer. Also Chief Innovation Officer at Strategic Blue, FinOps professional #20 and AWS Ambassador. Enough about me.

to this FinOps application on mobile. During the summer 2023, I noticed that there were no FinOps application listed on the AppStore. I needed to right this wrong, yet I had never worked on iOS and my latest app (on Android) was at least 15 years old. After some research, like a good 15 minutes, I settled for Titanium, an MVC framework allowing the creation of iOS and Android application using Javascript and XML. A really cool combination. 

As with every first encounter, it is important to get some easy win to keep the mojo going. The first version of the application is very (very, very) simple...ok, it is a list of links, and it took me 5 hours to make it happen as I learned the many aspects of iOS programming, including the payment to Apple for the dev program. 

v0.1 is a list of links and I hope to get it published on the AppStore. Plans for future versions include an RI breakeven calculator, an interface to interrogate AWS pricing API (because I have done it already in the past).

We will see, when I manage to find the time, and how many people will be able to help :)
