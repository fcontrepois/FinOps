Welcome to FinOps by Frank Contrepois.
=======================================

Hello and welcome. I am Frank Contrepois, a serial learner and pathological sharer. Also Chief Innovation Officer at Strategic Blue, FinOps professional #20 and AWS Ambassador. Enough about me.

to this FinOps application on mobile. During the summer 2023, I noticed that there were no FinOps application listed on the AppStore. I needed to right this wrong, yet I had never worked on iOS and my latest app (on Android) was at least 15 years old. After some research, like a good 15 minutes, I settled for Titanium, an MVC framework allowing the creation of iOS and Android application using Javascript and XML. A really cool combination. 

As with every first encounter, it is important to get some easy win to keep the mojo going. The first version of the application is very (very, very) simple...ok, it is a list of links, and it took me 5 hours to make it happen as I learned the many aspects of iOS programming, including the payment to Apple for the dev program. 

v0.1 is a list of links and I hope to get it published on the AppStore. Plans for future versions include an RI breakeven calculator, an interface to interrogate AWS pricing API (because I have done it already in the past).

We will see, when I manage to find the time, and how many people will be able to help :)

Welcome to Alloy. Prepare to be amazed.
=======================================

Titanium Alloys are metals which contain a mixture of Titanium and other chemical elements. Such Alloys have very high tensile strength and toughness (even at extreme temperatures). They are light weight, have extraordinary corrosion resistance and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures [1].  

Alloy for Titanium provides you, the developer, with the ability to run fast, jump high and generally code like an amazing superstar. 

Codestrong!

-------------------------
Now to the serious stuff.
-------------------------

Here's how your Alloy directory is laid out.

models              your model files go here
controllers         your controllers files go here
views               yep, the views go here. you're getting it
styles              your style (.tss) files for your views go here
assets              All files here will be deployed into Resources

Folders not generated by Alloy automatically, but the developer can create and use.

lib                 put your own libraries here and use require('name') to load it
migrations			generated model migrations go here
widgets				pre-built, reusable components for your Alloy apps.

In the root are the alloy.jmk file and config.json files. Alloy.jmk acts like a makefile and can be used to hook into the Alloy compiler to customize the build process. The config.json file is where you can declare runtime constants, and widget dependencies.

You'll also find a .vscode directory in your project root. It contains a settings.json file that hides folders that shouldn't be edited when developing Alloy applications. If you wish to see those folders then you can edit that file.
